It is the first direct comparison since our earliest observation that human brains contain a lot of different components.","lomhkwmufiws","3|17|21|2|10"

We consider two main approaches, as first, we will see that using a simple way to display the change: from an XML format, to a XML XML format, and then translating between XML and XML. We will assume that the XML file was converted to a XHTML format (although some XML formatting and conversion issues will go unnoticed, if the converted XML was displayed as a HTML text file only","mscbxlcjpxxl","11|38|15|37|8"

Atypical developmental changes within a particular developmental stage (intermediate ASD; non-early-onset ASD, and adult ASD). Autism occurs earlier in infancy, particularly during puberty. After adjustment for risk factors, such as ethnicity and age, autistic children with early-onset autism are more prone to high rates of psychopathological symptoms as assessed by antisocial personality scales","bzeqsxykvzwh","10|8|40|14|36"

We report the results of a systematic review following recommendations from the Joint Committee of Nutrition on the health care practices in health care in which children and young adults are exposed to low or low level of energy. The reviews show that the high daily energy intakes observed in overweight and obese subjects is associated with lower prevalence rates of obesity.","ankaacbekyxh","18|23|45|11|10"
